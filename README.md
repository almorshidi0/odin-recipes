# Odin-Recipes

First project of The Odin Project curriculum.

## Purpose

In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

## Learning Outcome

In this project, I am going to be using the things I learned up till now in the HTML lessons, including:

- Creating the websites homepage
- Putting text on the page
- Adding links to other webpages
